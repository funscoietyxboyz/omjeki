Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Muhammad Fadilullah Dzaki
A bug hunter specializing in AI and Machine Learning security. I have responsibly disclosed several critical vulnerabilities, including CVE-2025-47277, CVE-2025-11201, and ZDI-CAN-26649 under the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) program, and have been recognized in Microsoftâ€™s Hall of Fame for my contributions. My research focuses on identifying and exploiting weaknesses within modern AI/ML frameworks and pipelines such as unsafe deserialization, arbitrary file writes, command injections, and sandbox escapes to strengthen the overall security of artificial intelligence systems.
